transmission,Can Hepatitis B spread through sharing a toothbrush?,"Yes, hepatitis B can spread if you share personal items that can have even tiny amounts of infected blood (like toothbrushes or razors). The virus spreads through infected blood and certain body fluids, so avoid sharing items that could break the skin or have blood on them. For the situation you mentioned (sharing toothbrush), the risk depends on contact with infected blood or certain body fluids not casual proximity.",WHO: https://www.who.int/news-room/fact-sheets/detail/hepatitis-b | CDC: https://www.cdc.gov/hepatitis-b/prevention/index.html | Hepatitis B Foundation: https://www.hepb.org/prevention-and-diagnosis/transmission/
transmission,Is Hepatitis B transmitted through unprotected sex?,"Yes. Hepatitis B can be transmitted during unprotected sex because the virus is present in blood and sexual fluids.
